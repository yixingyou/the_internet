          <ol>
              <li>
                  The browser goes to the <span class="detial">DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span class="detail">server</span> that the website lives on.
              </li>
              <li>
                  The browser sends an <span class="detail">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.
              </li>
              <li>
                  If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span class="detail">"200 OK" mesage</span>, which means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks.
              </li>
              <li>
                  The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and desplays it to you!
